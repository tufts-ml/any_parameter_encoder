## Any-Parameter Encoder (APE)

This is the code used to generate the results in the paper.

The entrypoint is `run.py`. You can customize the details of the run based on the flags available.

NOTE: It is much more straightforward to navigate the `ape` branch, which is a work-in-progress refactor of this codebase. For instance, there are parts of this repository to enable experiments and visualizations that did not make it into the final paper.
